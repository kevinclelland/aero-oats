      <p class="font-sans first-letter:font-serif first-letter:text-3xl p-2">Flying all the way to Ibiza to race when the US Champs are on the same weekend on my doorstep was always a risk.</p>
      <p class="font-sans p-2">I know I want to race the biggest races against the best. There was a bit of a body adjustment to cater for the long travel and time zone difference.</p>
      <p class="font-sans p-2">The build up and race week went well but on race morning things seemed a bit off. I just couldn't feel like I was waking up and even ordered another coffee to try snap me out of it!</p>

   <p class="first-letter:font-serif first-letter:text-3xl">One of my key goals for this race was to just have a really great swim. Unfortunately I can't quite say I achieved this. Not that I had a bad swim, but, I was just really slow off the mark and was visibly the last person to jump in when the gun went off.</p>
     <br />
   <p>I got confused when the refree was calling us all back and I took a step back just as the gun went off and I was immediately on the back foot...literally.</p>
     <br />
   <p>Apart from the start, the water was also super choppy which I have always struggled to swim in. That being said, I found it great to practice swimming in these conditions in a slightly more bunched up and "aggressive" swim where I needed to jostle with the other swimmers to keep my place. I don't often get to do that on the smaller on more spread out race fields.</p>

   <p class="first-letter:font-serif first-letter:text-3xl">I came out of the water in an okay position but with some other strong athletes. A group of four of us were just over a minute down on Lucy Charles-Barclay but there were one or two other fast swimmers between Lucy and us. I do have this feeling that I perhaps should have been up the road with them with how strong my swim usually is.</p>
    <br />
   <p>When I started peddaling I could feel like it wasn't going to be a good bike. I just lacked something and I'm not quite sure what it was. I just really struggled on the bike which is not typical for me.</p>
    <br />
   <p>The best way I can describe it is that I just didn't have any energy. I could get to my power numbers but it was a big of a slog to get there and I found it difficult to maintain with the creeping lower on each lap.</p>
   <br />
   <p>I was desperate to quite and had all but made my mind up that I would when I got to T2. I had slipped down from 6th to 16th which should never happen!</p>

          <p class="first-letter:font-serif first-letter:text-3xl">I had looked for Sean in T2 to basically tell him I was pulling out and to some small extent get his "ok"...but I couldn't see him?! For some reason this made it impossible for me to throw the towel in.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Daniela Ryf was just in front of me and also having a bad day. I thought that if she can just jog this run out then I may as well too. My aim was to catch up to her and then run together to the end.</p>
          <br />
          <p>By the time I caught her I was running quite a bit faster so just carried on past her. I seemed to get over my flatness and found a rythm and kept pushing on.</p>
          <br />
          <p>In the end I actually had a solid run which was the 10th fastest overall. I also ran myself up from 15th in to 10th place which, thinking about it, is a very good result for having such a flat day!</p>
          <br />
          <p>Some lessons learned and i'm glad I was able to make the most of it and not quit.</p>
