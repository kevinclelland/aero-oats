<p>HI! I'm <span class="text-ao-pink font-bold">Aero MaccaFrodownlee</span>!ðŸ‘‹</p>
<br>
<p>I spend my days soaking up all things Triathlon and hope to share whatever I feel is interesting. I started a newsletter in 2023 and have been sending out weekly emails ever since.
   My aim is to be conversational while sticking to a few bullet points that will be:</p>

<ul class="list-disc p-4">
<li>Easy</li>

<li>To</li>

<li>Read</li>
</ul>

<p>Frequency of mails:</p>

<ul class="list-disc p-4">
<li>Friday preview of upcoming races</li>

<li>Monday recap of the races as well as a summary of the past week</li>
</ul>

<p>I have loads of unread newsletters in my inbox that I can never seem to find a quiet moment to get through. Hopefully my bullet point format will make reading my mails possible. Please keep me honest with this and let me know if I get a bit wordy!</p>
<br>
<p>If you're on social media, why not give me a little follow? Insta: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aerooatstri/"><span class="text-sky-600">@AeroOatsTri</span></a> or Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/AeroOats"><span class="text-sky-600">@AeroOats</span></a>. You can also email me on "aero at aerooats.com"</p>

<p>Who am I? A late thirty something age-grouper from South Africa who has been doing the sport since 2003. I've gone from:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc p-4">
        <li>Trying to swim 600m without stopping to rest</li>
        <li>Dreams of making the Olympics</li>
        <li>Dreams of doing an Ironman</li>
        <li>Dreams of doing Kona</li>
        <li>Hoping to get a personal best</li>
        <li>Just trying to stay consistent amongst work and family</li>

    </ul> 

<p>Yours in low CdA,</p>
